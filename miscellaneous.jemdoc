==Miscellaneous

I play all kinds of video games, especially hard core ones. Starcraft2, Dota2, Baldur's Gate, Monster Hunter are among my favourites, to name a few. I also like playing tabletop games such as MTG, Go and Bridge (although not very good at them).\n

I listen to rock, jazz and classical music. I play a little guitar, some pieces I play from time to time: La Catedral, Cavatina, El Decameron Negro, Capricho Arab e.t.c.\n

I enjoy reading philosophy (Surangama Sutra, Also sprach Zarathustra, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus...) and short fictions (Salinger, DÃ¼rrenmatt e.t.c.). I am a mechanistic materialist.
