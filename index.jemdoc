== About me
I am a PhD candidate at Princeton University. I am a receipient of the Gorden Wu Fellowship and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Before Princeton, I received B.S. (Summa Cum Laude) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2019. 

== Research
My research interests lie in online optimization, efficient deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning.
